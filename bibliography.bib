To achieve that, FIRE/J transforms each regular expression into a tailor-made class file, which is compiled directly to Java virtual machine (JVM) bytecodes.

A forward transform converts byte-oriented character stream data into eight parallel bit streams. Decoding, validation and computation of UTF-8 indexed UTF-16 bit streams are performed using bit-parallel logic and shifting operations. Conversion from UTF-8 indexing to UTF-16 indexing is performed using parallel bit deletion. The inverse transform is applied to yield high and low UTF-16 byte streams which are then merged. Combined with optimization techniques for blocks of ASCII data, speed-ups of 3 to 25 times are achieved on commodity processors compared with optimized byte-at-a-time code. Further applications of the method of parallel bit streams to bulk text processing applications are briefly discussed along with future prospects for the combination of intraregister and intrachip parallelism on multicore processors.},

Building on the bitwise data parallelism previously applied to the manual implementation of token scanning in the Parabix XML parser, the new algorithm represents a general solution to the problem of regular expression matching using parallel bit streams. On widely-deployed commodity hardware using 128-bit SSE2 SIMD technology, our algorithm implementations can substantially outperform traditional grep implementations based on NFAs, DFAs or backtracking. 5X or better performance advantage against the best of available competitors is not atypical. The algorithms are also designed to scale with the availability of additional parallel resources such as the wider SIMD facilities (256-bit) of Intel AVX2 or future 512-bit extensions. Our AVX2 implementation showed dramatic reduction in instruction count and significant improvement in speed. Our GPU implementations show further acceleration.},
