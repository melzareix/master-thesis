In recent years, Regular Expressions have been used in many applications throughout the data analytics pipeline. Such applications include recommendation systems, natural language processing (NLP), and graph processing. These applications involve processing large data sets of tens or hundreds of Gigabytes. The size of the datasets makes writing a performant regular expression matching engine a challenge. This thesis presents our prototype automata-based, SQL-compliant RegExp matching engine implemented on top of the LLVM toolchain. Our engine compiles Regular expressions into a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that matches the pattern. It then passes the DFA to a code-generation module (built on top of LLVM) that compiles it into efficient machine code. Performance evaluations of the prototype to other popular general-purpose regular expression engines (RE2 and PCRE2) on a dataset with 32 million rows and four patterns, we achieved up to $2.7x$ speedup against PCRE2 and up to $1.8x$ speedup against RE2. These results show that our approach is promising, and adding code-generation and compilation is beneficial when used against large datasets, and many runs amortize the cost of compilation.
